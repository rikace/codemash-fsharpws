// =====
(*
    Now that we have the building blocks to represent ideas 
    in F#, we have all the power we need to represent a real world problem in the language of mathematics.

    In this simple example we were able to represent and evaluate a four-function mathematical expression using only a discriminated union and a pattern match. You would be hard 
    pressed to write the equivalent C# in as few lines of code because you would need to add additional scaffolding to represent these concepts.

// This Discriminated Union is sufficient to express any four-function
// mathematical expression.
