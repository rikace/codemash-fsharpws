(*
    Every morning on your way to the office, you pull your car up to your favorite coffee shop 
    for a Grande Skinny Cinnamon Dolce Latte with whip. 
    The barista always serves you exactly what you order. 
    She can do this because you placed your order using precise language that she understands. Y
    ou donâ€™t have to explain the meaning of every term that you utter, 
    though to others what you say might be incomprehensible
